      <div class="content">
      <p> Single coil pickups are magnetic transducers, which electromagnetically transforms the vibration of the strings into a form of electric signal.</p>
      <p>While single-coil pickups have an incredible signature sound,they can be extremely noisy, as they are sensitive to electromagnetic interference.</p>

          <div class="content">
        <p>A humbucking pickup, humbucker, or double coil, is a type of guitar pickup that uses two coils to cancel out the interference picked up by coil pickups caused by electromagnetic interference, particularly mains hum.</p>
          <p>By connecting the coils together out of phase, the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation.</p>
          <p>The string signals from both coils add up instead of canceling, because the magnets are placed in opposite polarity.</p>
          <p>The coils can be connected in series or in parallel in order to achieve this hum-cancellation effect, although it is much more common for the coils of a humbucker pickup to be connected in series. </p>

        <div class="content">
      <p>The P-90 (sometimes written P90) is a single coil electric guitar pickup produced by Gibson since 1946.</p>
      <p>Gibson is still producing P-90s, and there are outside companies that manufacture replacement versions.</p>
      <p>Being a single-coil design, the tone of a P-90 is somewhat brighter and more transparent than a humbucker, though not quite as crisp and snappy as Fender's single-coil pickups.</p>
      <p>The tone therefore shares some of the single coil twang, but having large amounts of midrange and often described as thick.</p>

      <div class="content">
      <p>A rail pickup uses a single rail in place of a row of six pole pieces in each coil of the pickup.</p>
      <p>One advantage to a rail pickup is that the strings never leave the full magnetic field of the pole piece, even when a string is bent. With “conventional” pickups, a bent string can end up between two pole pieces and may drop in volume or change tone due to the change in magnetism.</p>
      <p>Another advantage is that string spacing is not an issue; no matter the string spacing at the bridge or nut, each string will be properly aligned with the rail.</p>
      <p>A disadvantage of a rail is that it is impossible to adjust the response of the pickup on a per-string basis. With a “regular” pickup, each string has its own adjustable pole piece(s) that can be used to balance their volume.</p>
      <p>Another disadvantage of a rail is that it can only be adjusted “globally”; bass side up or down and treble side up or down.</p>

  <div class="head1">
  <p>Electric Guitar Bridges are of two types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><h5>Fixed</h5></li>
    <li><h5>Tremolo or Floating or Vibrato</h5></li>
  </ul>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Also known as hardtails, fixed bridges are screwed into the body of the guitar and keep the strings in place resting on saddles. Each end runs from the body up to the headstock.</p>
      <p>Strings come standard with ball ends, so naturally, the fixed bridge will accommodate their functionality. The ball ends are kept in place by a small hole only wide enough for the string to pass through – located either at the bridge tailpiece itself or from the back side of the guitar body.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Tune-O-Matic Bridge</h3>
    <img class="img4" src="https://menga.net/wp-content/uploads/lespaulbridge.jpg" alt="image">
    <div class="content">
    <p>These type of bridges are mostly found on Les Pauls, but Gibson and some of the other brands provide this bridge on other guitar models too.</p>
    <p>This apparatus often consist of two pieces – a tailpiece which has adjustable screws, and the actual bridge which contains the saddles. However, there are some versions of the Tune-O-Matic that have just the bridge portion of it, and instead of using a tailpiece, the strings are fed through the guitar’s body in the back, kind of like the hardtails. This is sometimes referred to as a String-Through type.</p>

      <div class="content">
      <p>A synchronized tremolo is a type of bridge of an electric guitar. A type of this tremolo was first released in 1954 on Fender's first legendary Stratocaster.</p>
      <p>The basis of the synchronized tremolo is a rigid assembly incorporating both the bridge and tailpiece which is pivoted on the guitar belly. The strings pass through the tremolo and the body of the guitar and are anchored in the tremolo block below the bridge.</p>
      <p>Six bridge saddles are held against this plate by string tension, individually adjustable both for height and intonation. Another of the components which make up the tailpiece consists of a solid block of metal, commonly made of zinc.</p>
      <h5>PROS</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to maintain.</li>
        <li>Strings can be changed easily.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>CONS</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Goes out of tune easily due to continuous use.</li>

      <div class="content">
      <p>The 2 point tremolo was introduced by Fender as an improvement over the vintage 6 screw tremolo.</p>
      <p>The design is almost similar to the synchronised trem but instead of 6 screws, only 2 screws were fitted on the sides</p>
      <p>Therefore the design proved to be beneficial and offered better tuning stability compared to the old one.</p>
      <h5>PROS</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to maintain as compared to 6 screw trem.</li>
        <li>Strings can be changed easily.</li>
      </ul>

      <img class="img4" src="https://img2.stewmac.com/product/images/33721/Floyd_Rose_Special_Series_Tremolo_System.jpg" alt="image">
      <div class="content">
      <p>A tremolo system patented by Floyd Rose, also called a “double-locking vibrato“. A double-locking system is so named because both the <strong>floating bridge and the nut</strong> clamp down on the strings, locking them in place and preventing them from going out of tune when the vibrato arm is used and abused. The concept behind a double-locking system is that there are three points at which the strings can bind or slip out of tune when a vibrato arm is used: the bridge saddles, the nut, and the tuning machines. By clamping the strings at the bridge and the nut, all three of these points are removed from the tuning stability equation.</p>
    </div>
      <h3 class="head2">The Locking Nut</h3>
      <img class="img4" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L_GzVxG4sVg/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="image">
      <div class="content">
      <p>The locking nut design is a key feature of the Floyd Rose System.Since the nut is one of the main places a string will get hung up, altering the basic nut design altogether goes a long way toward maintaining tuning stability.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="head2">The Bridge</h3>
    <img class="img3" src="https://guitaristlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190116_210502.jpg" alt="image">
      <div class="content">
      <p>The Bridge functions in a similar way as other pivot tremolo bridges. Two adjustable screws mounted on the body of the guitar create a fulcrum along with the plate of the bridge itself. Springs within the guitar’s body cavity counteract the tension of the strings. Thus, pulling and pushing on the tremolo arm changes the tension on the strings, causing notes to go sharp or flat.</p>
      <p>In conjunction with the locking nut, this is the revolutionary “double lock” that changed the way guitarists looked at the whammy bar. The strings can’t budge, not at the bridge or the nut, and in theory once they are brought to pitch they should stay in tune even under extreme duress.</p>
    <h5>PROS</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>The greatest advantage of double locking system is if set up correctly, a guitar can sustain a huge amount of abuse without going out of tune.</li>
    <li>Pull notes sharp as far as you can, or mash the tremolo arm against the guitar body, and the strings will still come back to pitch.</li>
    <li>Shredders and metal guitarists especially appreciate how this bridge stands up to the abuse they can dish out, because the bridge can sustain huge whammy dives or string bends without any inntonation issues.</p>
    </ul>
    <h5>CONS</h5>
    <p>As it turns out, there are some negatives here as well.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Changing strings take much more more longer time because you have to deal with the complex hardware. At first you have to unlock the locking nut,then adjust the bridge system.</li>
      <li>If one string breaks, the other strings automatically go out of tune. Also you to follow a particular pattern while tuning the strings.</li>
      <li>Bridge requires a lot of maintainence compared to other tremolos</li>
      <li>"Licensed Floyd Rose" or any other cheap priced double locking trems do not hold tune well and inntonation issues may arise. Try to purchase only original Floyd Rose or premium segment double locking trems</li>

      <div class="content">
      <p>The Bigsby was the first successful design of what is now called a whammy bar, vibrato bar, or tremolo arm.The origin of this nonstandard usage of the term by electric guitarists is attributed to Leo Fender, who also used the term "tremolo" to refer to what is really a vibrato effect.</p>
      <p>The Bigsby vibrato unit is installed on the top of the guitar and works in conjunction with a 'rocking bridge'.The arm of the Bigsby is spring-loaded and attached to a pivoting metal bar, around which the strings of the guitar are installed. In the neutral or unused position, the pressure of the spring counterbalances the pull of the strings, resulting in constant pitch when the strings are played.</p>
      <p>Bigsby vibratos are still factory installed on a variety of electric guitars, including certain instruments branded as PRS (Starla), Epiphone, Fender, Gibson, Gretsch, Guild, Hamer, Ibanez, Schecter Guitar Research as well as luthiers companies such as MotorAve.</p>
      <h5>PROS</h5>
      <p>Bigsby bridge, though very old, still looks aesthetically good on Les Pauls. Also tuning remains stable if set up properly.</p>
      <h5>CONS</h5>
      <p>String changing is bit difficult. Also it cannot sustain whammy abuse like double locking trems,so dont expect much from it.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p> Eric Stets developed this tremolo system in the late ‘80s, and patented it in 1995. He originally designed the device to provide a stable vibrato system that could retrofit to “stop-tail” (fixed tailpiece) guitars such as the Gibson Les Paul with no permanent modifications to the instrument.</p>
        <p>When a player moves the vibrato bar up or down, the bridge operates with a linear motion in the same plane as the guitar strings. A Tune-O-Matic style bridge mounted on the bridge plate also holds the string anchor block. The bridge plate moves over a pair of linear roller bearings in the base plate.</p>
        <h5>PROS</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Can be easily installed on guitar body with much effort.</li>
          <li>If one string breaks,the other strings still stay in tune which is the biggest advantage of this bridge.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>CONS</h5>
